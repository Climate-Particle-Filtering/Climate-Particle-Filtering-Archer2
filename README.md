# Climate-Particle-Filtering-Archer2

Currently under development, the software will enable:

 - An ensemble of UKESM model instances to be started with differing start dumps (or some encoded perturbation)  - as determined by the researcher.

      - After all instances have run a while ( a year or much less for testing):
      - restart dumps are reorganised, according to criteria (e.g. goodness of fit against observation -  algorithm that is implemented by the researcher)
      - the runs then are then continued for the next while
