# Climate-Particle-Filtering-Archer2

The Particle Filtering software enables:

 - An ensemble of UKESM model instances to be started with differing start dumps (or some encoded perturbation)  - as determined by the researcher.

      - After all instances have run a while ( a year or much less for testing):
      - restart dumps are reorganised, according to criteria (e.g. goodness of fit against observation -  algorithm that is implemented by the researcher)
      - the runs then are then continued for the next while
      
Docuemntation of the software and an example for familiarisation are being added to the wiki.

Currently, as for the related OptClim software, the GeosMeta service is also needed, which entail registering for that service.
